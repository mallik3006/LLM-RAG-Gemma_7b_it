# LLM-RAG-Gemma_7b_it

### Introduction

The repo is a demonstration of implementing RAG paradigm using an open-source LLM (Gemma-7B-instruct). Gemma is Google's open source lightweight LLM model. The work also compares results or responses based on different approaches and RAG variations (advanced vs naive).
